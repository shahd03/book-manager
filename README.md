A command-line application to manage your personal library. Track books you've read, want to read, and generate comprehensive reading reports.

## **Features:**

- **Advanced Search**: filter by author, genre, publication year, or reading status
- **Statistics Dashboard**: view reading progress and collection insights

- **Database Operations**: full CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update operations)

## **Requirements:**
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## **Installation & Setup**
### **1. Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shahd03/book-manager.git
cd book-manager
```

### **2. Create Virtual Environment:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### **3. Install Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### **4. Configure the Database:**
The application uses a .env file for configuration (like the database location), which is not included in the git repository for security.

You can copy the provided example file to create your own configuration:

```bash
copy .env.example .env #On Windows
cp .env.example .env #On macOS/Linux
```
Edit the new .env file. The default setting will create a database file called books.db inside a data/ folder in the project root. You typically do not need to change this.

### **5. Initialize the Database:**
```bash
python main.py --init
```
### **6. Start the Application:**
```bash
python main.py
```

### **Available Commands:**
Once running, you can choose from these options:

1. **Add a new book**: enter book details including title, author, genre
2. **View all books**: display all books in your collection
3. **Search books**: filter by author, genre, or reading status
4. **Update book status**: mark as read/reading/unread
5. **View statistics**: see reading progress and collection insights
6. **Generate collection report**: export all books to CSV/Excel
7. **Generate reading report**: export reading statistics by genre
8. **Exit**: close the application
